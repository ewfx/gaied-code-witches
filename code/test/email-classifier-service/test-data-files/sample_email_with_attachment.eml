Dear Loan Servicing Team,

I am reaching out to request an adjustment on Loan Account #123456 due to a d=
iscrepancy in the latest statement.

It appears that the interest calculation for last month is incorrect. Could y=
ou please review and reallocate the interest? Additionally, if any principal =
reallocation is required, kindly process it and confirm the changes.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
John Doe
